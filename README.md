## Overview

Volt is a **keyboard-driven HTTP client** that lives in your terminal. Built as a project with Go and the [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) TUI framework, and high-performance HTTP client design.

**Perfect for developers who:**
- Live in the terminal and hate context switching
- Want Postman's features without the Electron bloat
- Love Vim keybindings and keyboard-driven workflows
- Need a fast, scriptable HTTP client with a beautiful UI


> **Note**: This is an active learning project. Performance optimizations are ongoing, and contributions/feedback are welcome :)

## Installation

Volt is distributed as a single binary with no dependencies. The fastest way to install is using Go's built-in package manager.

### Quick Install

If you have Go installed, you can install Volt with a single command:

```bash
go install github.com/owenHochwald/Volt/cmd/volt@latest # install
volt # run and verify
```


You should see the Volt TUI interface launch. Press `Esc` twice to quit.
**Updating Volt:**
To update to the latest version, simply run the install command again.

**Troubleshooting:**
If you get a "command not found" error, ensure `$GOPATH/bin` is in your PATH:
```bash
# Add to your ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, or equivalent
export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
```
---

## Quick Start

Once installed, launch Volt's interactive interface:
```bash
volt
```
**Basic usage:**
- Type a URL and press `Ctrl+Enter` or `Alt+Enter` to make a request
- Press `?` to see all keybindings
- Press `Esc` twice to quit, or `Ctrl+C` to quit immediately

See the [keybindings guide](docs/keybindings.md) for every contextual shortcut
and macOS Option-key setup.

## CLI Load Testing

Volt also includes a powerful little HTTP load testing tool for direct access, accessible via the `bench` subcommand.

```bash
volt bench [flags]
```

### Examples

```bash
# Basic throughput test
volt bench -url http://localhost:8080 -c 100 -d 30s

# POST request with custom headers
volt bench -url http://localhost:8080/api -m POST \
  -b '{"test":true}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"

# JSON output to file for CI/CD
volt bench -url http://localhost:8080 -c 50 -d 60s -json -o results.json

# Rate-limited testing
volt bench -url http://localhost:8080 -c 10 -d 30s -rate 1000

# For help!
volt bench -h
```
